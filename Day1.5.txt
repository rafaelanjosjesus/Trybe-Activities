Create a variable called “weekDay” that receives the string “Wednesday”.

Using if/else, implement the following conditionals:

If the variable “weekDay” is “Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”, “Thursday” or “Friday”, print “Yay, another day of learning at Trybe >: D”.

If the variable is some weekend day, print “FINALLY, well deserved rest! UwU!”.

Try changing the string value or even building your own algorithm. This subject is very important for your learning!
