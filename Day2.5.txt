Dealing with arrays
Consider this array to carry out the next exercises.

Copy
let numbers = [5, 9, 3, 19, 70, 8, 100, 2, 35, 27];
Iterate through the array by printing all the values ​​contained in it with the console.log().

Add all the values ​​contained in the array and print the result.

Calculate and print the arithmetic mean of the values ​​contained in the array .

The arithmetic mean is the result of the sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
Based on the code you just generated, make this: if the final value is greater than 20, print the message “Value greater than 20”; and, if it is not greater than 20, print the message “Value less than or equal to 20”.

Using for, find the largest value contained in the array and print it.

Find out how many odd values ​​are in the array and print the result. If none exists, print the message: “No odd value found”.

Using for, find the smallest value contained in the array and print it.

Using for, create an array that goes from 1 to 25 and print the result.

Using the array you just created, print the result of dividing each of the elements by 2.
