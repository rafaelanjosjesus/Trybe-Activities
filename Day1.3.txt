Creating conditional structures with operators if/elseand logical operators will be very common in your career as a developer. So let's practice this very important skill?

Create a variable that takes a candidate's grade in a technical challenge and assigns it a value between 1 and 100.

Implement a logic that checks whether the candidate has been approved, rejected or is on the waiting list. To do this, consider the following information:

If the grade is greater than or equal to 80, print “Congratulations, you are part of the group of approved people!”.
If the score is less than 80 and greater than or equal to 60, print “You are on our waiting list.”.
If the grade is less than 60, print "Unfortunately, you failed.".
Create a conditional structure using if, else ifand elseto create your algorithm and the logical operators that apply to each situation.
Change the note value to verify that the conditions you implemented work.
